# Project Reflections

## Steven's part

### Steven's job throughout the project was to start working on getting all the pages linked together and making the login page.
Also, it was to create the backend of the project to save the data from the To-Do list. He came up with the inital calendar page but Nick
added on to it and made it more interactive.

## Nick's part

### Nick's job throughout the project was to work on some documentation and the About Page. He also made the To-Do list and all
that came with that including the Javascript for it to actually work. He also improved on the calendar and helped with the css for multiple pages.

## Chase's part

### Chase has done documentation throughout the project and has also made the inital design for the Login page.
