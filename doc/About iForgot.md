# Why use iForgot Organizer?

* Ease of Use
* No sign-up required, uses Facebook login
* Simple To-Do List that can be edited and deleted
* Calendar that is easy to read
* Will continue to add features to enhance user experience

# Okay, that's all cool but how do I get started?

### To get started, all you have to do is go to iforgotorganizer.xyz and click the "Login with Facebook" button.

#### After you have logged in, you are now ready to get organized.

#### For your convenience, a calendar has been put at the top of the screen so you can easily see what day it is and check when a certain day is.

#### There is also a To-Do list that is very easy to use. There are only a couple things you need to know about it.
* To add an item to the To-Do list, all you need to do is type in what you need to do and then hit the 'Add' button.
* Once you add an item, the item will automatically go into the 'Doing' section where you can edit it, complete it, or delete it.
* To edit the item, you need to click the 'Edit' button beside the task.
* To complete the task, all you need to do is click the check box beside the task.

# Nice! You are now organized!

#### Once you're done with editing the To-Do list, just simply hit the 'Logout' button on the top right of the webpage.

# Wait, but won't I lose my data?

#### Well, our team has implemented a system that will keep all of your saved To-Do items and we will keep them locked away from the L33t Hackerz. To retreive your tasks, just log in and well put everything back in the To-Do list for you!

# Well now that I know how to use it, How did you do it?

#### That's a great question, our team has implemented a series of HTML webpages that incorporate a wide variety of languages to get the best interactive software for the user.
#### We used languages such as CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

## So really, give it to me straight, how does it work?

#### We have implemented Facebook login through the API they provide. We have decided to use this because we have all went to a website that required us to make an account and I for one, am tired of getting emails and having 500 thousand logins.
#### The Organizer, or home page, has a calendar that gets auto-updates from the javascript that accompanies it. The calendar itself was made using CSS and HTML.
#### The To-Do list was made using a series of Javascript and HTML also. All of the edit, add, delete, and complete functions are included in the javascript and the actual framework of the To-Do list is HTML.
#### We save data using PHP and store it on our server. The data we save is only the To-Do list data. This is another advantage to using Facebook login as we do not have to store any emails or passwords.

# All that being said, can I rely on it if I'm up at 2 am and need to check on what I have to do?

### Of course! Our website is hosted on a server that has a 99.9% uptime and any updates to the site would be scheduled.

# The last and most important question, how much do I need to pay to use it?

### We as a team were thinking we would charge something small like $5,000 a user, but we have decided to keep use of the website free of charge.
