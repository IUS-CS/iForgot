# Testing the product

## To test our website, we have used Selenium to test the user interface.
## This testing includes:

* Logging in with Facebook

* Using the To Do list to add tasks ("Do HW / Study For Test / Finish Lab / Study / Study For Final / Create Pull Request")

* Verify the Adding works

* Check incomplete tasks

## More testing will be done with the backend code using unit testing.
