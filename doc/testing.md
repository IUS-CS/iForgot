# Testing the product

## To test our website, we have used Selenium to test the user interface.
## This testing includes:
* Logging in with Facebook
* Navigating between pages 
* Logging out of Facebook
* Using the To Do list to add, delete and edit items

## More testing will be done with the backend code using unit testing.
